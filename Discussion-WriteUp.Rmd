Some concerns about limitation?

1. filter unknown data as missing data?
2. only 2k data - cannot represent shandong? okay to generalize to other city? 
3. okay to only focus on farmers? what about education and urban factors

4. hard to say which method is high fatality one - farmers + pesticide / building- jumping 

5. ?
