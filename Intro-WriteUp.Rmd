## Background 

Suicide is a significant public health issue in China, particularly among rural populations and younger individuals. Although the overall suicide rate has declined substantially in the past two decades, it remains the leading cause of death for individuals aged 15 to 34 years (Jia & Zhang, 2012). Rural areas continue to experience suicide rates that are two to three times higher than urban regions, reflecting disparities in access to resources and mental health services (Jia & Zhang, 2012). Additionally, cultural factors such as collectivism and family harmony play an important role in shaping psychological experiences, especially during periods of family conflict or peer victimization, both of which have been linked to increased suicidality (Ai et al., 2017).

Some research has emphasized the demographic factors such as gender, age, location, occupation, and education background and suggested their impact on suicide rate. Investigating these risk factors in the context of China’s unique social and cultural environment is critical for understanding the dynamics of suicide and for informing targeted prevention strategies.

One the other hand, the 2008 global financial crisis had far-reaching consequences for rural China, particularly its agricultural sector. While urban areas grappled with industrial layoffs, rural regions experienced disruptions in farming due to the decline in agricultural exports and increased financial strain. The crisis caused a significant reduction in the global trade of agricultural products, severely affecting the livelihoods of Chinese farmers who depended on crop sales for their income (Hung, 2020). In response, the Chinese government implemented a 4 trillion RMB stimulus package aimed at stabilizing the economy, which included measures to support agricultural productivity and rural development (Shiraishi & Yano, 2022). However, these interventions failed to address the deeper vulnerabilities of rural communities, where farming remained heavily dependent on unpredictable market and environmental factors. Against this backdrop, this project aims to investigate whether fatality rates from suicide varied across the years 2009, 2010, and 2011, and to explore how these temporal changes might reflect the broader socioeconomic challenges faced by rural farmers during and after the financial crisis.

However, the definition of suicide attempt is ambiguous and hard to explicitly define. High-lethality and low-lethality suicide attempts differ significantly in terms of intent, planning, and associated risk factors. High-lethality attempts are often characterized by greater planning and intent, suggesting a deliberate and less impulsive approach, while low-lethality attempts tend to occur in more reactive, emotionally charged situations (Zhang et al., 2022). These distinctions imply that the populations engaging in these two types of attempts are heterogeneous and may require different preventative strategies. This project will build on these findings by examining the factors that distinguish high-lethality and low-lethality suicide attempts in the dataset. By modeling and comparing these two groups, the research aims to uncover critical predictors of fatality rates and contribute to more tailored intervention strategies (Zhang et al., 2022).
