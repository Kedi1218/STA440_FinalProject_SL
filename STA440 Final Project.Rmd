```{r}
# Using readr for better performance

suicide_data <- read_csv("SuicideChina.csv")

```
```{r}

head(suicide_data)

# Check data structure

Let's do some EDA first 


```{r}
# Frequency of 'Died'
table(suicide_data$Died)

# Frequency of 'Sex'
table(suicide_data$Sex)

# Frequency of 'Urban'
table(suicide_data$Urban)

# Frequency of 'Method'
table(suicide_data$method)

```

```{r}
# Summary of Age
summary(suicide_data$Age)
